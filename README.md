# Introduction
This is a small but powerful OpenGL game engine I developed for my team for the course CSE 125 at UCSD. Although the engine is programmed in only a month, it supports most features of a modern game engine, such as playing skeletal animations, rendering shadows, adding complex particle systems, playing positional audios, etc. More importantly, it is very straightforward to use: you load the textures, models, and other types of assets to the engine and update their properties according to your game's logic, and that's it. You can try out the [released demo](https://github.com/KelinLyu/KGLEngine/releases) first. Although the engine is not perfect, it is suitable for doing small game projects as long as you are familiar with C++, GLSL, and one modeling software like MAYA. Anyway, let's get started!
